      "   3. First, I should think about what Fabrinet is known for. They're a company that provides components for the automotive industry, right? So their products might include things like connectors, sensors, or other automotive parts. The user is probably looking for information on what exactly they offer in the automotive sector.\n",
      "   4. To make the search queries specific, I need to include keywords related to their products. Maybe start with \"Fabrinet automotive products list\" – that's straightforward. Then, think of different angles. Maybe their applications in electric vehicles? Since that's a big trend. So \"Fabrinet automotive components for electric vehicles\" could be another query.\n",
      "   5. Another angle could be the types of products they offer. Maybe connectors or sensors. So \"Fabrinet automotive connectors and sensors\" would be a good one. Also, including terms like \"suppliers\" or \"manufacturers\" might help. Wait, the user might want to know if they are a supplier or manufacturer. So \"Fabrinet automotive product suppliers\" could be another query. But maybe that's too broad. Alternatively, \"Fabrinet automotive product catalog\" to get a list of their offerings.\n",
      "   6. Wait, the example given in the query had \"specific search term 1\", \"alternative search term 2\", etc. So I need to make sure each query is distinct.

Also, considering that Fabrinet might have specific product lines, using terms like \"types\" or \"categories\" could help.\n",
